Personally built a web app that allows a user to make an account and login. Consists of user authentication and sessions.
Users are then able to track different characters and items in the game Dota 2 using the Steam API. 
Users can make posts, comments and add any build that a player has made to a post. Built in Ruby on Rails and Vue.js.
